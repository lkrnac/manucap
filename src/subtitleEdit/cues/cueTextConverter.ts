/**
 * We are removing <br> here, because converter is sometimes returning "\n<br>" and sometimes "<br>\n".
 * It can be related to this issue: https://github.com/sstur/draft-js-utils/issues/62.
 * I am not 100% sure why this is happening. I tried "\n<br> -> \n" and "<br>\n -> \n" replacements, but
 * one or the other doesn't work fully and applying both of them might cause problems where new lines are removed
 * Notice we are applying these replacement rules sequentially so if we would have "<br>\n<br>\n<br>",
 * which would probably represent "\n\n\n", applying both ("\n<br> -> \n" and "<br>\n -> \n") would end up in "\n\n".
 * Therefore I would rather avoid reducing number of line breaks type of rules (e.g. "\n<br> -> \n")
